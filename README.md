## Ideas
- Well the user should in theory be visiting the tracker every week to update their personal weekly reports, you could therefore implement some sort of reward scheme that gives them something for visiting it each week.
	- In primary school I did this homework thing online where each time you completed a task, you would get a form of experience points and you would race everyone in your class to get the most points. Just a thought, though its probably more complicated then it seems.
	- Potentially send out a reminder to the user each week to update their CPD to be rewarded with some form of reward.

- For each set amount of words entered/time spent the player gets to play a recreation of a classic arcade game?

- The player could create an avatar they can customise.

- A diary sort of design that you can customise.

- Some sort of pet management game which survives by consuming information that the player enters about their weekly development? Thinking a bit like Tamagotchi where if they leave it for too long, it will die.

- Add the cpd to the attendance, ensuring it is completed weekly
